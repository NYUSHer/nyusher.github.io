## What is NYUSHer

A HTML5 based cross-platform app which gathers every students / professors / stuff of one school into a centralized platform through .edu emails. NYU people repeat similar task everyday across multiple platforms such as weather app, wechat, facebook, calendar, OrgSync, and etc. We brings these scattered platform into one centralized app, including functionalities such as chatting, momenting, todo-dashboard, and calendar.

## Detailed infomation

Students can create sub-forms in categories and chat freely. Every message is kept for new come-ins, so students are exposed to every information in the campus. Also, the app supports multiple forms of message. Users can send not only bare text messages, but also voice, pictures, videos, stickers, voting poll, docs, .etc, publicly or privately, parallely getting statistics about how many people have read and how popular your messages are.
	Furthermore, users can decorate their own dashboard to get information instantly. They can put bus schedule, room vacancy, todo list onto the dashboard to make the day arranged.

## Motivation

It has alway been frustrating for me to switch between many website everyday to complete daily school tasks. I have observed and asked some of my friends and they are also experiencing the same problem, so this is a school-wide pain point. Also, our school does not have an online platform where everyone can post information. A campus craigslist-like website can help students spread their words faster.

## Comparison

Some of our appâ€™s core functions may have an overlap with other apps that are dedicated to them. For example, chatting vs WeChat & Facebook; forum vs WeChat Moments & Facebook group posts; classroom assistance vs NYU Classes; personal information vs Albert. But as each of them is dedicated to certain functions, by combining them and focusing on life at NYU Shanghai, our app can organically co-exist with those apps and further help improve user experience at NYU Shanghai.
